# Shopping API Serverless

Trying to convert my estimate API to a serverless API.

## Build
Nothing is needed except `npm i`

## Test
Run `npm test`
or `npm test:watch`

## Config
There is a config file for `env` params in my dropbox :)

## API definition
There is an API definition file in my dropbox :)

## Deploy
I removed all build steps when moving to `cloudant` so the `gulpfile` is not longer needed to deploy
